            <Description>These data files contain suprathermal electron pitch 
angle distribution functions (s^3 cm^-6) at 272 eV from the ACE/SWEPAM-E 
instrument. The energy channel is ~12% wide, centered at 272 eV. Pitch 
angle bins are 9 degrees wide, and run from 0 to 180 degrees (so 0-9, 
9-18, 18-27 degrees, etc.).

The break between the core and suprathermal electrons is generally 
around 70 eV at 1 AU, but varies around this value, at times exceeding 
100 eV. Electrons at 272 eV are generally well within the suprathermal 
range, and the distribution at this energy typically shows very little 
contribution from the core population. The measured count rates at 
272 eV energy provide excellent statistical significance. In addition, 
because of the high count rates, very few artifacts (for example due 
to sunlight contamination) are seen in the data at this energy.

The data are in the solar wind frame, and have been corrected for the 
spacecraft potential. The spacecraft potential determination requires 
measurement of the lower energy electrons, and so the potentials 
calcuated at these times have been interpolated to the times of the 
suprathermal electron measurements. Transformation to the solar wind 
frame requires interpolation of the measurements (each at a different 
energy in the solar wind frame) to the desired energy (272 eV).

Also note that the detector gains on the SWEPAM-E instrument change 
over time, including both slowly decreasing gains and abrupt increases 
when the instrument voltages are increased. The use of these data for 
long-term studies of the distribution function amplitudes is therefore 
strongly discouraged.</Description>
